### About Me

I grew up in Auckland, New Zealand and studied Commerce and Science at the University of Auckland. 

I'm now based in Seattle/New York City working on Azure Data Security and Governance Engineering at Microsoft. My [career](https://www.linkedin.com/in/helenamjackson/) has focused mostly on enterprise customer outcomes across Product Management, Technical Service Delivery, and Volume Licensing. 

I also write about, invest in, or build things I'm interested in. Iâ€™m particularly drawn to ideas that drive innovation or increase access to opportunity.

In my spare time, I read, explore new cities, and get outdoors.
