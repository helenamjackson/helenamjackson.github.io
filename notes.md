### Notes

This blog is intended to be an exercise to explore whether structuring and writing up my thoughts, impressions, reactions, and reiterating things helps me better make connections between ideas and helps me to become better at communicating them.

One of the ways I’ve found where I’m better able to understand ideas is when I have the opportunity to apply something in the real world, or try to explain it.

Originally I wanted to write for myself to curate my thoughts privately, but I realized that having an audience, no matter how small, is probably an important part of what makes it valuable. I aspire to improve the content as I find typos, mistakes, incorrect information, or change my mind - so consider anything here a work in progress or my view at a point in time.

If anything I write sparks an idea for you, or you disagree with anything, please reach out to let me know.
